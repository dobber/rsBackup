Plan to rewrite rsbackup procedures for general multi-server rsync/snapshot server farms

rsBackup is a system for daily backups using rsync as a primary method of sync

1) what the user wants
	- daily (or more often) full file backup
	- always latest backup - easy to switch to backup disk in production
	- incremental backups - can be rolled over the full backup
	- sync with gzip or gzip archive before syncing
	- backup schemas - every server/disk/application requires a different backup
		- pre-made lvm snapshots with mysql backup, cpanel user backups, etc
	- modular - can write their own logging, snapshot procedures
		- hook into (almost) every step - before schema, schema, after schema, before sync, sync, after sync, etc
	- require (almost) zero configuration for basic stuff, can work as a nuclear plant
	- connect from backup server to main server - better security
		- try to run as a simple user with sudo
	- different storage systems
		- single disk
		- remote server with (multiple) disks
		- Amazon S3
		- Dropbox, Google Drive
		- Other storages
	- integrate with other popular server management systems
	- cli interface
		- automatic discovery of servers/disks
		- add/edit/delete/view backup server/disk
		- add/edit/delete/view master server/disk
		- add/edit/delete/view schema
		- add/edit/delete/view module
		- view operations, logs, stats
	- web interface
	- stats - local stats
	- will not support ftp, scp, netcat, etc
	- monitoring - nagios
	- stats - observium, etc
